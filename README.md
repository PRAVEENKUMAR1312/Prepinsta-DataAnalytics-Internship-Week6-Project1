Prepinsta Week6 Project1

Description

This project involves an in-depth data analysis using Python, focusing on understanding, cleaning, and visualizing the dataset. By leveraging various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, the project aims to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data.

Key Features


Understanding the Dataset: Initial exploration and summary of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing various EDA techniques to uncover insights and trends within the data.

Visualizations: Creating a variety of visualizations to represent the data effectively, including histograms, bar charts, box plots, pie charts, counter plots, correlation matrices, stacked bar charts, violin plots, and point plots.

Libraries and Tools Used


Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Numpy: For numerical operations, offering support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
